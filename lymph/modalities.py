    """Dictionary storing instances of a diagnostic `Modality` for a lymph model.

    This class allows the user to specify the diagnostic modalities of a lymph model
    in a convenient way. The user may pass an instance of `Modality` - or one of its
    subclasses - directly. Especially for trinary models, it is recommended to use the
    subclasses `Clinical` and `Pathological` to avoid ambiguities.

    Alternatively, a simple tuple or list of floats may be passed, from which the first
    two entries are interpreted as the specificity and sensitivity, respectively. For
    trinary models, we assume the modality to be `Clinical`.

    For completely custom confusion matrices, the user may pass a numpy array directly.
    In the binary case, a valid `Modality` instance is constructed from the array. For
    trinary models, the array must have three rows, and is not possible anymore to
    infer the type of the modality or unambiguouse values for sensitivity and
    specificity. This may lead to unexpected results when the confusion matrix is
    recomputed accidentally at some point.

    Examples:

    >>> binary_modalities = ModalityDict(is_trinary=False)
    >>> binary_modalities["test"] = Modality(0.9, 0.8)
    >>> binary_modalities["test"].confusion_matrix
    array([[0.9, 0.1],
           [0.2, 0.8]])
    >>> modalities = ModalityDict(is_trinary=True)
    >>> modalities["CT"] = Clinical(specificity=0.9, sensitivity=0.8)
    >>> modalities["CT"].confusion_matrix
    array([[0.9, 0.1],
           [0.9, 0.1],
           [0.2, 0.8]])
    >>> modalities["PET"] = (0.85, 0.82)
    >>> modalities["PET"]
    Clinical(specificity=0.85, sensitivity=0.82, is_trinary=True)
    >>> modalities["pathology"] = Pathological(specificity=1.0, sensitivity=1.0)
    >>> modalities["pathology"].confusion_matrix

           [0., 1.],
